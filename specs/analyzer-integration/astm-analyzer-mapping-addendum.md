## Change Log

| Version | Date | Author | Changes |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| 1.2 | 2026-02-25 | Casey | Addendum: Analyzer Profile System (FR-22, FR-23, FR-24), Lab Unit association (FR-25), profile JSON schema, profile library management, import/export, built-in profile catalog, community repository support |

---

## Purpose of This Addendum

The v1.1 addendum defines the full configuration surface for a generic ASTM plugin — connection settings, test code mappings, QC rules, value transformations, field extraction overrides, result aggregation, and abnormal flag mapping. With this configuration surface complete, a critical operational question arises: **how does an administrator get a new analyzer configured quickly and correctly?**

Currently, the v1.0/v1.1 workflow requires building every configuration from scratch — manually entering each test code, QC rule, and extraction override. This is error-prone and slow, especially for instruments like the Indiko Plus with 50+ test codes.

This addendum introduces the **Analyzer Profile System**: a portable, shareable JSON format that captures a complete analyzer configuration. Profiles serve as the new unit of deliverable for analyzer support — instead of shipping a compiled Java plugin, the OpenELIS community ships a JSON profile file that any site can import, try, and customize.

### Key Capabilities

1. **Analyzer Profile (FR-22):** Portable JSON file containing the complete analyzer configuration (connection defaults, test code mappings, QC rules, value transformations, extraction overrides, abnormal flag mappings, aggregation settings). Profiles are the new standard deliverable for analyzer onboarding.

2. **Profile Library (FR-23):** Built-in profiles ship with OpenELIS for common instruments. Administrators can also upload profiles to a shared site library, or import profiles downloaded from the OpenELIS community repository.

3. **Profile Selection in Analyzer Setup (FR-24):** The "Add Analyzer" modal replaces the former "Analyzer Type" field with an "Analyzer Profile" selector. Selecting a profile pre-fills all configuration including connection defaults, protocol version, test code mappings, and QC rules. All pre-filled values are editable. "None (Start from Scratch)" is always available.

4. **Lab Unit Assignment (FR-25):** New multi-select field on the analyzer registration form, tied to the system-configured lab units (ref: Lab Units Management FRS). Replaces the former single "Analyzer Type" dropdown which was a lab-department categorization. Lab units are configurable per site, making this both more accurate and more flexible.

## New Functional Requirements

### FR-22: Analyzer Profile Format

The system shall define a portable JSON format for complete analyzer configurations. A profile captures every setting that is configurable through the analyzer UI (v1.0 + v1.1), excluding site-specific identifiers (analyzer name, unique database IDs) and runtime state (pending codes, last-modified timestamps).

#### FR-22.1: Profile JSON Schema

```

#### FR-22.2: Profile Scope

A profile contains all configuration **except**:

| Included in Profile | NOT Included (Site-Specific) |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Connection defaults (role, default port, timeout, retry) | Analyzer name |
| Protocol version | Actual IP address (for client mode) |
| Field extraction positions | Actual listen port (pre-filled from default, but user confirms) |
| Test code mappings with suggested OpenELIS test matches | OpenELIS test ID bindings (resolved at import time) |
| QC identification rules | Database primary keys |
| Abnormal flag mappings | Runtime state (pending codes, last modified) |
| Value transformation rules + configs | Lab unit assignments (site-specific) |
| Aggregation mode + window | Analyzer status (always starts as Setup) |

#### FR-22.3: Test Code Mapping Resolution

When a profile is imported, each `testCodeMapping` entry includes a `suggestedTestName` and `suggestedTestCode`. The system attempts automatic matching:

1. **Exact code match:** If an OpenELIS test exists with the same `testCode`, auto-bind (status: `mapped`)
2. **Fuzzy name match:** If test code doesn't match but test name matches (case-insensitive), suggest as probable match (status: `suggested`)
3. **No match:** Leave unmapped with the suggested name visible for the administrator to resolve (status: `unmapped`)

The import summary shows match statistics: `X auto-matched, Y suggested, Z need manual mapping`.

#### FR-22.4: Profile Version Compatibility

- `profileVersion` tracks the schema version (currently `1.0`)
- `compatibleOpenelisVersion` uses semver range to indicate minimum OpenELIS version
- On import, the system validates both and warns if the profile was created for a newer version
- Backward compatibility: profiles from older schema versions are imported with defaults for missing sections

---

### FR-23: Profile Library

The system shall maintain a library of available analyzer profiles, sourced from three channels:

#### FR-23.1: Built-in Profiles

OpenELIS ships with profiles for common analyzers. These are read-only and cannot be deleted or modified. They can be duplicated.

**Initial built-in catalog (target):**

| Profile ID | Manufacturer | Model | Protocol | Tests |
|------------|-------------|-------|----------|-------|
| `indiko-plus-chemistry-v1` | Thermo Fisher | Indiko Plus | ASTM | ~48 |
| `maldi-biotyper-astm-v1` | Bruker | MALDI Biotyper sirius | ASTM | Organism ID |
| `vidas-immunoassay-v1` | bioMérieux | VIDAS | ASTM | ~12 |
| `stago-st4-coag-v1` | Stago | ST4/STA-R | ASTM | ~8 |
| `sysmex-xn-hema-v1` | Sysmex | XN Series | ASTM | ~30 |
| `mindray-bs-chem-v1` | Mindray | BS-200/300/400 | HL7 | ~40 |
| `mindray-bc5380-hema-v1` | Mindray | BC-5380 | HL7 | ~26 |

Built-in profiles are stored as JSON resources in the application package and loaded at startup.

#### FR-23.2: Uploaded Profiles (Site Library)

Administrators can upload `.json` profile files to the site library. Uploaded profiles:

- Are validated against the profile JSON schema on upload
- Appear in the profile selector alongside built-in profiles
- Can be edited (metadata only — name, description, tags) or deleted by admins
- Are stored in the database (not filesystem) for portability

#### FR-23.3: Community Repository Integration

The system shall support importing profiles from the OpenELIS community repository:

- **Download & Import:** Administrator downloads a `.json` file from the community site and uploads it via the standard import flow (FR-23.2)
- **Future (Phase 2):** In-app browser for community profiles with one-click import
- **No auto-sync:** Profiles are not automatically updated from the repository. Each import is a point-in-time snapshot.

#### FR-23.4: Profile Export

Any configured analyzer can be exported as a profile file:

- **Export action:** Available from the analyzer overflow menu (⋮ → "Export Profile")
- **Export behavior:** Serializes the current configuration to the profile JSON schema (FR-22.1)
- **Site-specific stripping:** The export process removes site-specific data (analyzer name, IP addresses, database IDs, OpenELIS test ID bindings) and replaces them with suggested names/codes
- **Metadata prompt:** Before export, user is prompted to provide profile name, description, author, and tags
- **File download:** Browser downloads `{profileId}.json`

---

### FR-24: Profile Selection in Analyzer Setup

The "Add Analyzer" modal shall include profile selection as the primary onboarding mechanism, replacing the former "Analyzer Type" field.

#### FR-24.1: Revised Add Analyzer Modal

| Field | Type | Source | Behavior |
|-------|------|--------|----------|
| Analyzer Name | Text input | Manual | Required. User enters site-specific name. |
| Analyzer Profile | Dropdown + Import | Profile Library | "None (Start from Scratch)" + all available profiles, grouped by source. Import button opens file picker. |
| Status | Dropdown | System | Default: Setup. Same as v1.0. |
| Lab Units | Multi-select (filterable) | System lab units | Select one or more lab units this analyzer serves. |
| Protocol Version | Dropdown | Profile or manual | Pre-filled when profile selected. Editable. |
| Connection Role | Dropdown | Profile or manual | Pre-filled when profile selected. Editable. |
| Listen Port / IP + Port | Conditional | Profile or manual | Pre-filled with profile defaults. User must confirm/adjust. |
| Connection Timeout | Number | Profile or manual | Pre-filled. Editable. |
| NAK Retry Count | Number | Profile or manual | Pre-filled. Editable. |

#### FR-24.2: Profile Selector UI

The "Analyzer Profile" field is a searchable dropdown with grouped options:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

```

**Carbon components:** `<ComboBox>` with `<FilterableMultiSelect>` grouping pattern, custom group headers.

#### FR-24.3: Profile Apply Behavior

When a profile is selected:

1. **Connection fields** pre-fill: role, default port, timeout, retry
2. **Protocol version** pre-fills from `profileMeta.protocolVersion`
3. **Info banner** appears below profile selector showing: profile name, version, author, test count, description snippet
4. **Modal saves** the analyzer with the profile reference
5. **On first visit to Field Mappings page:** Test code mappings, QC rules, extraction config, flag mappings, and transforms are populated from the profile. Auto-matching runs against existing OpenELIS tests (FR-22.3).
6. **Import summary notification** shows: "Profile loaded: X test codes (Y auto-matched, Z need mapping), N QC rules, flag mappings applied"

When "None (Start from Scratch)" is selected:
- All fields start empty/default
- Field Mappings page starts with empty tables
- Protocol version defaults to ASTM LIS2-A2

#### FR-24.4: Import from File

The "Import from File" option at the bottom of the profile selector:

1. Opens the browser file picker (accept: `.json`)
2. Validates the file against the profile JSON schema
3. On success: applies the profile to the current modal (same as selecting a built-in profile) AND adds it to the site library
4. On failure: displays validation errors inline
5. Option to "Import to library only" (save for later use without applying now)

---

### FR-25: Lab Unit Assignment

The system shall allow assignment of one or more lab units to each analyzer, replacing the former "Analyzer Type" (single-select lab department category) field.

#### FR-25.1: Lab Unit Multi-Select

| Field | Type | Data Source |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Lab Units | `<FilterableMultiSelect>` | `/api/lab-units?isActive=true` |

- Displays all active lab units configured in the system (ref: Lab Units Management FRS)
- User can select one or more lab units that this analyzer serves
- Selected lab units appear as tags/pills below the dropdown
- Searchable/filterable by lab unit name
- Optional — an analyzer can be saved without lab unit assignment during initial setup

#### FR-25.2: Lab Unit Display

- Lab units appear on the Analyzer List table as a new "Lab Units" column, displaying tags
- Lab units are included in the Analyzer List search and filter capabilities
- The Analyzer List "Status" filter is supplemented with a "Lab Unit" filter dropdown

#### FR-25.3: Lab Unit in Profile

- Profiles do NOT include lab unit assignments (these are site-specific)
- When a profile is applied, the Lab Units field remains empty for manual selection
- Lab units are included in profile export metadata as `suggestedLabUnits` (informational only, not auto-applied)

---

## New Business Rules

### BR-18: Profile Schema Validation

All imported profile files must validate against the published JSON schema. Invalid files are rejected with specific validation error messages.

### BR-19: Profile ID Uniqueness

Within the site library, `profileMeta.id` must be unique. Importing a profile with an existing ID prompts the user to either replace the existing profile or save as a new profile with a generated suffix.

### BR-20: Built-in Profile Immutability

Built-in profiles cannot be modified or deleted. They can only be:
- Selected for a new analyzer (applies a copy)
- Duplicated to the site library for customization

### BR-21: Profile Export Sanitization

Export strips all site-specific data:
- Database IDs (UUIDs, foreign keys)
- Analyzer name
- IP addresses and actual port numbers (replaced with defaults)
- OpenELIS test ID bindings (replaced with `suggestedTestName` + `suggestedTestCode`)
- Lab unit assignments (replaced with `suggestedLabUnits`)
- Runtime state (pending codes, timestamps)

### BR-22: Lab Unit Association

- Lab unit assignments do not affect analyzer functionality (no filtering of results by lab unit in this version)
- Lab units are informational/organizational for the analyzer list view
- Future versions may use lab unit assignments for role-based access control and result routing

---
